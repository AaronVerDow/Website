# Community Garden Website

This is the code which generates the Maslow Community Garden website which you are most likely reading. Meta right?


The community garden exists as a place to help facilitate collaborative open source projects.

The garden is a project of the [Maslow CNC](https://www.maslowcnc.com) community. Everyone is welcome and pull requests to improve the site are appreciated.

Every five minutes the website is automatically generated from a list of tracked Github repositories. The website is generated from a python script.

You can build your own version of the site by running the python script `python buildSite.py` the home page will be index.html. This can also be a good way to test any proposed changes to the design of the site.
