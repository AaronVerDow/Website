# How to create a project

To create a new project click the "Add A Project" button at the top of the page. This will take you to a simple form to create a new project.

The form is designed to allow you to create a new project quickly and easily. Most of the elements of the project can be changed later if you want.

The form will ask you for the following things:

- **Project Title** This is the name of the project. It cannot be changed later because it will be used to choose the URL for the project.
- **A Project Description** A short description of what the project is.
- **Your GitHub Username** This is your username for [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is important because GitHub is the system we use for collaboration. You will automatically be sent an email invitation through github giving you access to edit the project files. Don't have an account? Make a free one [here](https://github.com/join).
- **A Main Picture** This picture will show up in the list of projects in the community garden.
- **A Zip Folder of Project Files** These are the files which your project will start off with. Files can easily be updated, added, or removed later. If the project has very large files it is probably easier to upload them later.
- **How do you want the project controlled** If you select "community managed" the community will be able to vote to approve or reject proposed changes to the project (you will still be able to make changes as the creator). If you choose that you want to manage then ONLY YOU will be able to approve changes to the project.

When you are ready click "Create" and your project will be generated! 

The website refreshes every few minutes so it may be several minutes before your project shows up.
