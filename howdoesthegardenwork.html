    <h1 class = 'title'> How does the garden work? </h1>

    <br>
    <br>


    <p>The Maslow community garden is a place for the community to share designs and files.</p>

    <p>The garden is different from other design sharing sites in three ways.</p>

    <h1>Forums not comment sections</h1>

    <p>We believe in dialog not comments so every project gets a forum where the community can collaborate, dialog, and work together. (Not yet implemented) </p>

    <h1>Repositories</h1>

    <p>Instead of having static files controlled by a single project creator, the garden stores files in GitHub repositories making it possible for the community to collaborate, contribute, and maintain a projects design files.</p>

    <h1>Distributed</h1>

    <p>Each project is self contained. The community garden website is automatically regenerated every minute from a list of tracked projects. This means that there is no central organization responsible for ownership of design files.</p>

    <p>Let's have fun and make amazing things!</p>
