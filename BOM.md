Every project in the community garden has a "Buy" tab which contains a BOM and ideally links to buy the necessary parts to make the project.

This tab fulfills two important roles. 

First, since most of the projects we are working on here are physical things in the real world it having a reference to the right hinge, bolt, or paint to make a project work is important.

Second, while the community garden is designed to be very low cost to run, it would be ideal for the garden to be self sustaining to ensure it's future. Linking to for sale items could some day cover the operating costs of the garden.
